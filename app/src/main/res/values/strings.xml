    <string name="about_text"><b>GPS</b> is a system of 30+ navigation satellites circling Earth.
        We know where they are because they constantly send out signals.
        A <b>GPS</b> receiver in your phone listens for these signals.
        Once the receiver calculates its distance from four or more <b>GPS</b> satellites, it can figure out where you are.
        \n\n<u>GPS obtains information from satellites which is why the internet is not required for collecting and storing location data.
            The internet is only needed in order to access the data remotely and GPS trackers have a SIM card within them to enable connection.</u>
